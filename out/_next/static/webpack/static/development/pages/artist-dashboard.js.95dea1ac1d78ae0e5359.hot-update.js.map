There was not a browse page because artists gained supporters by linking their page to social media.\n              <br /><br />\n              To better understand the importance of a discovery feature I made proto-personas based on user feedback and gained insight through making an empathy map. \n          </div>\n          <br /><br />\n          <img className=\"grid-image\" style={{ maxWidth: 686 }} src=\"/discovery-empmap.png\"/>\n              <br /><br />\n              The empathy map helped me see the problem and <i>why</i> people were asking for the discovery feature. The most significant insight was that people were <i>evaluating the credibility</i> of the platform based on how many users it had. People were also frustrated because they <i>expected</i> to have a discovery experience like other social platforms. \n              <br /><br />\n              A discovery page gives users more insight into how many people are using the platform and if the people using it are interesting or similar to them.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n          <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Problem</div>\n          <p>\n          How might we gain user’s trust and help them find interesting artists?\n          < br/><br />\n          How might we make a feature lean enough to not distract from the platform's other priorities?\n          < br/><br />\n          How might we create a sense of ownership? <i>(This is a value we want to uphold as a cooperative with every design decision)</i>\n          </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n          <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Why is this important?</div>\n          <p>\n              Artist discovery is not a primary goal of the platform but I learned that an artist discovery page would aid in <strong>credibility</strong> (which is especially important because we are a new platform asking people to enter their credit card information), a sense of <strong>community</strong>, and better <strong>inform</strong> new users about the platform.\n          </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n          <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">What does success look like?</div>\n          <ul>\n              <li>Trust from musicians and supporters</li>\n              <li>Increased number of artists and supporters</li>\n              <li>New users understand how the platform works</li>\n          </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n          <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Ideation & Iteration\n          </div>\n          <img className=\"grid-image\" style={{ maxWidth: 686 }} src=\"/discovery-sketch.png\"/>\n          <br />\n          <div>I collaborated with the engineering team to understand the capabilities of the filter and search infrastructure.

Featured artists are based on a combination of factors: a recently updated supporter page, number of supporters, and how long the artist has been on the platform. This combination allows for the featured artists to always be changing, be active/current artists, and be artists who have some amount of content to show.\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"grid full-width\">\n              <img className=\"grid-image extra-top-padding-sm\" style={{ maxWidth: 686 }} src=\"/discovery-3.png\" />\n          </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n          <div>\n              <strong>Default filter states lead to a better understanding</strong>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n              I maintained simple and slimmed down filter categories (i.e.: only included major cities instead of all cities) in order to balance the priorities of the platform.

There is still room to make the search filters more robust so that more artists can be easily found. I think it would also be important to have the artist-owners contribute more to the discovery experience like making artist curated-sections. \n      </div>\n      <style jsx>{`\n          a {\n              text-decoration: underline;\n          }\n          .before {\n              color: #EE595B;\n          }\n          .after {\n              color: #2AC3A9;\n          }\n          .quote-text {\n              font-weight: normal;\n              font-size: 18px;\n              line-height: 36px;\n              padding: 36px;\n              padding-bottom: 72px;\n              background-image: url(\"/quote-container.svg\");\n              text-align: center;\n          }\n          .grid-image-scheduling {\n              object-fit: cover;\n              width: 100%;\n          }\n          .portfolio-piece-img {\n              max-width: 721.67px;\n          }\n          .problems {\n              // display: flex;\n              // flex-direction: row;\n              align-items: center;\n          }\n          .problems > .section-subheader {\n              flex: 0 0 none;\n              padding-right: 40px;\n          }\n          .disclaimer {\n              font-family: Roboto;\n              font-weight: 300;\n              font-size: 18px;\n              line-height: 30px;\n              margin-left: 42;\n          }\n          .color-swatch {\n              display: inline-block;\n              width: 18px;\n              height: 18px;\n              background-color: #3582EC;\n              margin-right: 8px;\n           }\n           .color-swatch.blue {\n              background-color: #3582EC;\n           }\n           .color-swatch.green {\n              background-color: #2AC3A9;\n           }\n           .color-swatch.purple {\n              background-color: #A964E7;\n           }\n           .color-swatch-text {\n              font-size: 16px;\n              line-height: 16px;\n              margin-right: 20px;\n           }\n           .color-swatch-container {\n              padding-top: 16px;\n              padding-bottom: 16px;\n              align-items: center;\n              display: flex;\n           }\n           .grid-image {\n              max-width: 100%;\n              width: 100%;\n           }\n           .sub-panel.gray {\n              padding: 20px;\n           }\n           .no-wrap {\n              white-space: nowrap;\n           }\n          @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n              .disclaimer {\n                  margin-left: 42px;\n              }\n              .sub-panel-subheader {\n                  margin-bottom: 16px;\n                  font-size: 16px;\n              }\n          }\n          @media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {\n              .meta {\n                  width: 100%;\n              }\n              .portfolio-piece-img {\n                  margin-bottom: 50px;\n                  width: 300px;\n              }\n              .problems {\n                  flex-direction: column;\n              }\n              .problems > .section-subheader {\n                  padding-right: 0x;\n              }\n              .quote-text {\n                  font-size: 12px;\n                  line-height: 26px;\n                  padding: 24px 12px;\n                  padding-bottom: 50px;\n              }\n              .quote-text:first-of-type {\n                  margin-bottom: 18px;\n              }\n              .grid-image-scheduling {\n                  margin-top: 30px;\n               }\n              .grid-image-scheduling:first-of-type {\n                  margin-top: 0px;\n               }\n              .sub-panel {\n                  white-space: normal;\n              }\n               .sub-panel:first-of-type {\n                  margin-bottom: 18px;
