The numbers and check marks would be clickable so you can go back to change your answer. \n            < br/><br />\n            After answering each question the user will either move on to the next question or be directed to their result. For example, if they answer yes to the first question they would be directed to the ‘ineligible’ result without completing the rest of the steps. In a design critique we decided that the sudden jump in this context may be too abrupt and cause confusion.\n            </div>\n        </div>\n            <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n            <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Version 2\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            Alternatively, I designed an abstract horizontal progress bar showing how far the user has progressed but without concrete numbers. The abstract progress bar causes less confusion for someone who may jump to the results early on in the quiz compared to Version 1. \n            < br/><br />\n            Version 2 follows the Tech Equity style guidelines with some minor changes that I made in order to be WCAG compliant.            \n            <br></br>\n            <img className=\"grid-image\" style={{ maxWidth: 686, marginBottom: 30 }} src=\"/TE-V2.png\"/>\n            </div>\n        </div> \n            <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n            <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Team testing\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            I tested the two design versions with our cross functional team. We decided that Version 2 was the winner. Version 2 followed enough well known design patterns that I didn’t think it need as much testing compared to another project our team was also working on at the time. I decided to use the rest of my time to test the more complex design project and keep this one leaner.\n             <br></br>\n             <img className=\"grid-image\" style={{ maxWidth: 686, marginBottom: 30 }} src=\"/TE-MDMOCK.png\"/>\n             </div> \n        </div>\n        <div className=\"casestudy-panel\">\n            <div className=\"section-subheader extra-top-padding-sm\">Next Steps\n            </div>\n            <div>\n            Engineering is currently building the quiz. I will help with the QA process along with other team members to ensure the design is implemented accurately. Then the plan is to release the quiz locally to only the Bay Area so that we can work out any issues that may arise before releasing to all of California.             </div>                   \n        </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        <style jsx>{`\n            a {\n                text-decoration: underline;\n            }\n            .before {\n                color: #EE595B;\n            }\n            .after {\n                color: #2AC3A9;\n            }\n            .quote-text {\n                font-weight: normal;\n                font-size: 18px;\n                line-height: 36px;\n                padding: 36px;\n                padding-bottom: 72px;\n                background-image: url(\"/quote-container.svg\");\n                text-align: center;\n            }\n            .grid-image-scheduling {\n                object-fit: cover;\n                width: 100%;\n            }\n            .portfolio-piece-img {\n                max-width: 721.67px;\n            }\n            .problems {\n                // display: flex;\n                // flex-direction: row;\n                align-items: center;\n            }\n            .problems > .section-subheader {\n                flex: 0 0 none;\n                padding-right: 40px;\n            }\n            .disclaimer {\n                font-family: Roboto;\n                font-weight: 300;\n                font-size: 18px;\n                line-height: 30px;\n                margin-left: 42;\n            }\n            .color-swatch {\n                display: inline-block;\n                width: 18px;\n                height: 18px;\n                background-color: #3582EC;\n                margin-right: 8px;\n             }\n             .color-swatch.blue {\n                background-color: #3582EC;\n             }\n             .color-swatch.green {\n                background-color: #2AC3A9;\n             }\n             .color-swatch.purple {\n                background-color: #A964E7;\n             }\n             .color-swatch-text {\n                font-size: 16px;\n                line-height: 16px;\n                margin-right: 20px;\n             }\n             .color-swatch-container {\n                padding-top: 16px;\n                padding-bottom: 16px;\n                align-items: center;\n                display: flex;\n             }\n             .grid-image {\n                max-width: 100%;\n                width: 100%;\n             }\n             .sub-panel.gray {\n                padding: 20px;\n             }\n             .no-wrap {\n                white-space: nowrap;\n             }\n            @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n                .disclaimer {\n                    margin-left: 42px;\n                }\n                .sub-panel-subheader {\n                    margin-bottom: 16px;\n                    font-size: 16px;\n                }\n            }\n            @media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {\n                .meta {\n                    width: 100%;\n                }\n                .portfolio-piece-img {\n                    margin-bottom: 50px;\n                    width: 300px;\n                }\n                .problems {\n                    flex-direction: column;\n                }\n                .problems > .section-subheader {\n                    padding-right: 0x;\n                }\n                .quote-text {\n                    font-size: 12px;\n                    line-height: 26px;\n                    padding: 24px 12px;\n                    padding-bottom: 50px;\n                }\n                .quote-text:first-of-type {\n                    margin-bottom: 18px;\n                }\n                .grid-image-scheduling {\n                    margin-top: 30px;\n                 }\n                .grid-image-scheduling:first-of-type {\n                    margin-top: 0px;\n                 }\n                .sub-panel {\n                    white-space: normal;\n                }\n                 .sub-panel:first-of-type {\n                    margin-bottom: 18px;
